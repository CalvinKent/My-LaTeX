# My-LaTeX
This repo includes my LaTeX documents.

NOTE: Ideally, you should only use the packages you need for your document. For ease of use, I included most of the packages I use in my preamble. This is very practical but highly inefficient.

Description of .sty files.

- **CKpreamble**: Preamble for every document.
- CKassignment: For assignments submitted via Crowdmark or printed assignments.
