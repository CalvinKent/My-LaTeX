# My-LaTeX
This repo includes my LaTeX documents.

Changes from v18:

- Cleaned the code and deleted unnecessary cluttering macros
- Merged Crowdmark.sty and PrintedAssignment.sty into CKassignment.sty
- Various macros behave accordingly to specific class. i.e. if the class is specified as PMATH 351, then the figures path is automatically set to figures/pmath351 folder etc.

NOTE: Ideally, you should only use the packages you need for your document. For ease of use, I included most of the packages I use in my preamble. This is very practical but highly inefficient.

Description of .sty files.

- **CKpreamble**: Preamble for every document.
- CKassignment: For assignments submitted via Crowdmark or printed assignments.
- CKlecture: For lectures notes.
